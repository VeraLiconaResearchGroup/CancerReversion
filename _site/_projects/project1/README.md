project1
==============================

### Description
This folder contains data, scripts, and results from the preliminary analysis for network construction. This project focused on developing the pipeline to construct an intracellular signaling network with multi-omics data. In this pipeline, DEGs were filtered against chromatin data to remove those not in open chromatin regions. This posed a problem because some genes in closed chromatin regions had gene expression or protein expression data, and CL TNBC relevant genes were excluded from the network. Therefore, project2 consists of our final network construction pipeline without this step.
