=========
## Description
Results of Virtual Screeenings of perturbations of FVS_12 applied to MDAMB231_3.


## Folder Architecture

**knn\_*dataset*.tar.gz** contains results of knn applied to the dataset (logss, DAC, both, and discrete versions) at k values from 2 to 8 using eucliden distance.

**knn\_*dataset*_hamming.tar.gz** contains results of knn applied to the dataset (logss, DAC, both, and discrete versions) at k values from 2 to 8 using hamming distance as a distance metric.

**perturb\_*dataset*.tar.gz** contains the estimated SFA attractors of the 100,000 FVS perturations.
