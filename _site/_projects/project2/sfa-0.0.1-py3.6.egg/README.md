==================

## Description
This folder contains the modified source files for signal flow analysis (SFA) developed by [Lee and Cho](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23643-5). The modifications to the `base.py`, `np.py`, and `sp.py` files allow for the value of nodes to be fixed to their initial state when SFA is run iteratively. The original source code can be found in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dwgoon/sfa)
