## Description

This folder contains the data, scripts, and documentaion for my work separated into projects.

The **geneXplain_backup** folder contains files downloaded from GeneXplain.

**project1** contains results from the preliminary construction of an intracellular signaling network for MDA-MB-231. 
This project focused on refining the network construction pipeline by incorporating methylation and mutational profiles, protein abundance, and gene expression data.

**project2** contains the construction of the final intracellular signaling network for MDA-MB-231. It also focuses on refining the pipeline for the identification and prioritization of putative reversion targets.
