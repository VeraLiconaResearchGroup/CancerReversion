## Using geneXplain

Each list generated by geneXplain was filtered for a yes/no ratio greater than 1.5 and a p-value less than 0.05. Then, they were filtered for only TFs that are expressed and in open chromatin regions as well as those in unmethylated regions according to [bisulfite data](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r110). This resulted in:

- A promoter window size of 500 generated [76](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TF_0500_expr_openchrom_unmeth.txt) expressed TFs in open chromatin regions
- A promoter window size of 1000 generated [69](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TF_1000_expr_openchrom_unmeth.txt) expressed TFs in open chromatin regions
- A promoter window size of 1500 generated [58](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TF_1500_expr_openchrom_unmeth.txt) expressed TFs in open chromatin regions
- A promoter window size of 2000 generated [59](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TF_2000_expr_openchrom_unmeth.txt) expressed TFs in open chromatin regions
- A promoter window size of 2500 generated [65](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TF_2500_expr_openchrom_unmeth.txt) expressed TFs in open chromatin regions

Next, weighted sums were calculated comparing to the same three lists as when determining functionally related genes:

![weighted sums]({{ site.baseurl }}\_assets\images\weightedsums_TF_graph_table.png)

From this graph, it is easy to see that step size 1000 produces the best list, so we will use this list when comparing to IPA results. If the intersection of the two lists does not cover all of the downstream genes, we will either take the union of the two lists or we will make the filtering discussed above less stringent.


## Using IPA
We ran TF analysis with IPA 4 different ways:

1. Looking at only data from MDA-MB-231 produced [5](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/IPA_TFs_231only.txt) TFs covering 8 downstream genes.
2. Looking at claudin-low cell lines produced [7](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/IPA_TFs_claudinlow.txt) TFs covering 9 downstream genes.
3. Looking at all breast tissues produced [33](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/IPA_TFs_breast.txt) TFs covering 21 downstream genes.
4. Looking at all tissues produced [138](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/IPA_TFs_all.txt) TFs.

## Intersection of IPA and geneXplain step 1000:

 - [1](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TFs_AP1000_AND_IPA_231only.txt) TF common with the IPA MDA-MB-231 only list
 - [1](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TFs_AP1000_AND_IPA_claudinlow.txt) TF common with the IPA claudin low list
 - [3](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TFs_AP1000_AND_IPA_breast.txt) TFs common with the IPA breast tissue list
 - [8](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project1/gene_network/TFs_AP1000_AND_IPA_all.txt) TFs common with the IPA all tissues list

Next, I checked the downstream coverage of the transcription factor lists.

*insert how one does this*

Both the list of 3 transcription factors from the IPA breast tissue list and the 8 TFs from the IPA all tissues list covered all of the downstream genes. However, the list of 3 TFs only has 3 known edges while the list of 8 has 16.

**Conclusion:** Move forward to TRANSPATH with both the list of 3 TFs and 8 TFs.
