Mutations
=========

## Description
This folder contains the mutational profile of MDA-MB-231 and the results of ensembl VEP.

## Folder Architecture

**231_otherstrand_output.vcf** contains the consequences of the mutations in **231_otherstrand.vcf** as predicted by ensembl VEP

**231_otherstrand_output.vcf_summary.html** is the html output of VEP applied to **231_otherstrand.vcf**

**231_otherstrand.vcf** is a vcf file containing the mutations in MDA-MB-231, but with base pair substitutions on the opposite strand from the COSMIC output (**231_SNV_COSMIC.vcf**).

**231_SNV_correct_output.vcf**  contains the consequences of the mutations in **231_SNV_correct.vcf** as predicted by ensembl VEP

**231_SNV_correct_output.vcf_summary.html** is the html output of VEP applied to **231_SNV_correct.vcf**

**231_SNV_correct.vcf** contains the mutations of MDA-MB-231 with the base pair changes encoded on the strand such that when ensembl VEP is applied, the correct amino acid base change is predicted

**231_SNV_COSMIC_output.vcf** contains the consequences of the mutations in **231_SNV_COSMIC.vcf** as predicted by ensembl VEP

**231_SNV_COSMIC_output.vcf_summary.html**  is the html output of VEP applied to **231_SNV_COSMIC.vcf**

**231_SNV_COSMIC.vcf** contains the mutations in MDA-MB-231 as downloaded from COSMIC.

**combine_protein_seqs.py** takes the separate reference and mutated protein sequences generated by VEP with the protein seqs plug-in and combines them into one file, complete.fa, to input to ReKINect

**complete.fa** is a fasta file containing reference and mutant protein sequences generated from VEP with protein-seqs plug in, with reference sequences labeled as <transcript>_reference and mutant sequences labeled as <transcript>:p.<mutation>.

**getRIGHTAA.py** was used to compile a vcf file with base pair changes on the correct DNA strand so that VEP predictions of amino acid changes are accurate

**mut1.fa** is **mutated.fa** but without the new lines

**mutated.fa** is a fasta file with protein sequences of mutated proteins generated by ensembl VEP with the protein-seqs plug-in

**mutant_genes_COSMIC** is a list of mutated genes from COSMIC data

**parseVCF.py** is a script to parse the VCF file to only contain entries for a predefined list of genes.

**ref1.fa** is **reference.fa** but without the new lines

**reference.fa** is a fasta file with the reference protein sequence for mutated proteins generated by ensembl VEP with the protein-seqs plug-in

**ReKINectOutput.txt** is the output of ReKINect

**switchVCF.py** prints a vcf with complement bases of the 231_SNV_COSMIC.vcf file to represent the mutations on the opposite strand.
