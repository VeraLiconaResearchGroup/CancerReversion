# Objective
Assemble the network components in Cytoscape 3. Total nodes: 460

## MRs to TFs

We used Lauren's new [`read_SBML.py`](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project2/Network_Construction/MRs%20to%20TFs/read_SBML.py) script to convert the .xml file downloaded from GeneXplain into a csv file of edges. Then we used [`transpathtogenesymbol.py'](https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/CancerReversion/blob/master/_projects/project2/Network_Construction/MRs%20to%20TFs/transpathtogenesymbol.py) to convert TRANSPATH IDs into gene symbol ids.

We removed several nodes that were not expressed but incorporated in the network: PGR, SEPT4, MAPK10, PRKN. This did not produce any additional source nodes. If there were unexpressed proteins in complexes, I left them as is. There are 184 nodes in this level (47 of which are SOC nodes)

## TFs to DEGs

I downloaded the file generated by geneXplain when I checked coverage of the 7 TFs.

I pulled:   
 - 40 edges from IPA  
 - 19 edges from OMNIPATH (confidence level A)  
 - 2 edges from ACSN  

 This left me with 244 uncovered SOC genes, so I used pearson correlation to estimate 421 unique edges. After this, 213 of the 316 SOC genes are covered by TFs but since some of the SOC genes are in the MR to TF level, more genes are covered overall. I have a total of **72 uncovered** SOC genes and no way to cover them.

Adding additional TFs from IPA did not significantly increase the number of Second Order FunDEGs with known TF regulators, so we will reconstruct the network using the set of First Order FunDEGs as the first layer of the network.
