## Objective
The objective of this exploration is to determine the limitations and appropriate uses for SFA. This post provides details from a preliminary analysis that made us realize we need a more robust intuition of how we can use SFA. The analysis was done using the T-LGL Boolean model and static network from [Zanudo and Albert](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004193).

## Comparing SFA results on static network to Boolean network 

1. Selected one initial state
2. Simulated the resulting attractor with iterative SFA to get the trajectory
3. Used **getPathtoAttractor()** function to get path from that initial condition to the attractor in BoolNet

**Result:** When setting SFA tolerance to machine epsilon, it took 37 steps before discretization to reach the attractor in SFA, which was similar to the 34 steps it took with the boolean model.

4. Needed to figure out how to discretize the SFA results to compare to BoolNet

## DiscreeTest
We used DiscreeTest to determine if there was an optimal discretization method for the SFA trajectory.

1. Ran as designed with the discretization of SFA time series data from GED PRO TOOLS to determine the best discretization option.
    -  Only kmeans with k=2 on the rows passed the qualification step
    - p-value = 0.066 ($\alpha = 0.01$)
    - MABC = 16.03

2. Ran with the same descritized data but comapring to the distribution of the Boolean trajectory instead of SFA. Qualifying methods:
    - mean across rows (pvalue = 0.09, MABC = 12.267)
    - mean across columns (pvalue = 0.13, MABC = 12.46)
    - equal width discretization with 2 levels (pvalue = 0.115, MABC = 12.45)
    - kmeans with k = 2 across columns (pvalue = 0.115, MABC = 12.45)

*Interesting:* The only discretization method that passed 1 did not qualify for 2!

3. Compared the final SFA attractor as discretized all the qualifying methods from above to the BoolNet attractor and found approximately 60% accuracy.
