- intro is good
- copy and paste part of table talking about clinical trials - to use a percentage of trials
- title: identification of combinations
- objective: identify targets for claudin-low (don't mention rerversion)
- least common explored idea, it is possible and has been observed over the last century, in particular with this subtype in vivo and in vitro
- do citations with exact number
- fix hallmark info (EMT and stemness together, then low proliferation(not a HOC))
- very little work has been done to quantitatively assess and study tumor reversion
	- want to do that to propose targets
- main point not so much the waddington landscape. main point is the idea of cacncer attractor
	- why we can go from cancerous attractor to normal
- read kauffman papers - pehnotype and cancer attractors
	- in dynamical systems the attractors can be associated to phenotypes (how to identify phenotypes of the system)
	- some least visited attractors in the system can be attributed to cancer 
	- system ends up in those phenotypes through mutations and microenvironment
	- want to quantitatively reprogram the cell to go from cacnerous to normal
	- main point: association of attractors to phenotypes, cancer attractors
- how? Apply control theory
	- what it means to control a system (graph)
	- Use FC - control approach developed for nonlinear dynamic systems to control only the attractors and we can directly modify the states of these driver nodes
	- we want to change the initial condition so it goes to the state we want
	- initial try structure beased so we can start with large data driven signalling networks to identify candidate control sets that can be confirmed through mathematical modeling
- make the citation of method a and method b clear in the pipeline slide
- explicitly say how we comput attractors
	- what sfa does and show the example
	- majority of time should explain how we are simulating the network to find the attractors
	- check how many simulations you had to run to reach the attractor
	- see how a system evolves until it reaches a steady state
	- simulating the network to estimate the steady states
- think about why heatmap is red and blue
- show that the heatmap at initial state mathches the one at the attractor state
- closer to the basin of attractor closer to the normal state
- using RONs as parameter of reference but we will approximate the attraactor landscape with signal flow
- when we do in silico screenings we will be able to access how close we are falling into the normal basin of attraction
- we did in sikico screeneings and we say that we were able to change x amount of nodes


- create one slide to breifly explain what SFA does and how we're computing attractors
- remove waddington landscape

- look at where we can present this, have abstract for tuesday
