## Description
Master Regulators (MRs) are the third layer of the network, consisting of genes, proteins, and molecules that regulate TFs through intracellular signaling pathways. See GeneXplain Backup Folder for intermediate files.

## Folder Architecture

**context proteins and FOC.txt** is the file used for context and weighting in the search for Master Regulators. It contains the average protein intensity data for MDA-MB-231. First Order FunDEGs without protein expression were addeded to this list and weighted 0.

**MRs expressed (prtn only) Genes Ensembl.txt** Contains the ensembl ID for 51 MRs with protein data
