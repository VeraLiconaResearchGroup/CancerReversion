## Description

This folder contains the results of discreetest. Here, we tried to identify an optimal discretization method for the SFA trajectory but had no luck.

**data** contains the SFA trajectory as well as several discretized versions for each Leukemia and Apoptosis intervention. 

**results** contains the result for each SFA attractor: which discretization methods pass the sign test, and which produce the smallest area between the curve.

**discreeTestSummary.docx** describes the results.
