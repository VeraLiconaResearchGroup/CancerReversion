This folder contains the result of our preliminary analysis done chosing an arbitrary attractor of the Boolean model and trying to replicate the results with SFA. We explored if states the basin of the Boolean attractor converged to the same attractor when simulated with SFA, and gauged if the trajectory produced by SFA was comparable to that in the Boolean model. Ultimately, we decided we needed a more rigorous and bioogically relevant analysis.
