# Cancer Reversion: Computational Systems Biology Approaches
This repository contains the source code and preliminary results for our computational pipeline for tumor reversion

## Cancer reversion
 is the biological process by which tumorigenic cells lose all, or a significant part of, their malignant phenotype. The objective of this project is to develop and apply novel computational systems biology tools to identify molecular drivers of cancer reversion, their mechanisms of action and their clinical application.



The hypothesis underlying this project is that cancer development can be reversed by identifying and targeting its key drivers through mathematical modeling and optimal control algorithms, in a precise manner that redirects a cancer cellâ€™s phenotype from malignant to normal-associated phenotypes.
The objective of this project is to develop and validate a computational systems biology pipeline for the construction and attractor landscape control of a static network and dynamic model of tumorigenesis for CL TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, SUM1315 and MDA-MB-436. The outcome of this pipeline will be combination on genes that when perturbed, enhance the likelihood of tumor cells moving from cancer-associated attractors to normal-like attractors. A translational objective of this proposal is to validate identified genes that control the development of cancerous cellular states of claudin-low triple negative breast cancer cell lines.
